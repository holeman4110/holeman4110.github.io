```
Answer:

+ routers that connect to the customer routers known as PE routers: LER
+ routers in the core of the provider network known as P routers: LSR
+ path along which the traffic flows across an MPLS network: LSP
+ all traffic to be forwarded using the same path and same label: FEC
+ used for exchanging label mapping information between MPLS enabled routers: LDP

Explanation

A label edge router (LER, also known as edge LSR) is a router that operates at the edge of an MPLS network and acts as the entry and exit points for the network. LERs push an MPLS label onto an incoming packet and pop it off an outgoing packet

A label is a short, four-byte, fixed-length, locally-significant identifier which is used in order to identify a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC). The label which is put on a particular packet represents the FEC to which that packet is assigned.

LDP provides a standard methodology for hop-by-hop, or dynamic label, distribution in an MPLS network by assigning labels to routes that have been chosen by the underlying Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing protocols. The resulting labeled paths, called label switch paths (LSPs), forward label traffic across an MPLS backbone to particular destinations.
```

#### 3. 예제

An engineer must establish a connection between two CE routers for two customers with overlapping IP addresses. Customer_a is connected to interfaces Gig0/0, and Customer_b is connected to interfaces Gig0/1. Routers CE1 and CE2 are configured as follows:

ip vrf customer_b
 rd 2:2
 route-target both 2:2
```
Drag and drop the code snippets from the right onto the boxes in the configuration to establish the needed connection. Snippets may be used more than once.

#### 5. 예제

Drag and drop the MPLS concepts from the left onto the descriptions on the right.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124491456/224635926-f9060e45-2b44-4fd0-8e0f-5bf73c10d321.png)

```
Answer:

+ allows an LSR to remove the label before forwarding the packet: penultimate hop popping
+ accepts unlabeled packets and imposes labels: label edge router
+ group of packets that are forwarded in the same manner: forwarding equivalence class
+ receives labeled packets and swaps labels: label switch router

Explanation

A label edge router (LER, also known as edge LSR) is a router that operates at the edge of an MPLS network and acts as the entry and exit points for the network. LERs push an MPLS label onto an incoming packet and pop it off an outgoing packet.

A forwarding equivalence class (FEC) is a term used to describe a set of packets with similar or identical characteristics which may be forwarded the same way; that is, they may be bound to the same MPLS label.

```
Answer:

+ packet is encapsulated in MPLS with the option of copying the IP precedence to EXP bits: explicit null label
+ provides ways of improving load balancing by eliminating the need for DPI at transit LSRs: entropy label
+ LSR receives an MPLS header with the label set to 3: implicit null label
+ controls the amount of memory used to store LDP label bindings advertised by other devices: inbound label binding filtering

Explanation

The MPLS LDP Inbound Label Binding Filtering feature can be used to control the amount of memory used to store Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) label bindings advertised by other devices. For example, in a simple Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Network (VPN) environment, the VPN provider edge (PE) devices might require label switched paths (LSPs) only to their peer PE devices (that is, they do not need LSPs to core devices). Inbound label binding filtering enables a PE device to accept labels only from other PE devices.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/mp_ldp/configuration/15-sy/mp-ldp-15-sy-book/mp-ldp-inbound-filtr.html

Egress LSR initially send a special label value of 3 to “next-to-last LSR” (called the penultimate LSR). This label 3 is called the IPv4 Implicit Null label. When an LSR receives an MPLS header in which the label is set to 3, it always POPs the header (it removes the top label).

The entropy label is protocol independent, it provides a unified way of load balancing without looking into the protocol header.

Note: DPI is short for deep packet inspection. DPI is performed to determine the load balancing.

When a packet or Ethernet frame is encapsulated in MPLS, you have the option of copying the IP precedence or 802.1p bits to the three CoS bits of the MPLS header i.e. EXP Bits.

If a POP is performed at the penultimate LSR, the EXP bits in the MPLS header are no longer available as a reference for queuing and the packet is queued on the outgoing interface according to the CoS behavior of the underlying payload (in Ipv4 packet, it will be ToS field). An explicit null (Label Value 0 for IPv4), on the other hand, leaves the MPLS header in place until it reaches the egress, preserving the LSP CoS behavior across the entire LSP.

```
Answer:

+ Block reply and advertisement messages from unauthorized DHCP servers and relay agents: IPv6 DHCPv6 Guard
+ Create a binding table that is based on NS and NA messages: IPv6 ND Inspection
+ Filter inbound traffic on Layer 2 switch port that are not in the IPv6 binding table: IPv6 Source Guard
+ Block a malicious host and permit the router from a legitimate route: IPv6 RA Guard
+ Create IPv6 neighbors connected to the device from information sources such as NDP snooping: IPv6 Binding Table

Explanation

The DHCPv6 Guard feature blocks DHCP reply and advertisement messages that originate from unauthorized DHCP servers and relay agents that forward DHCP packets from servers to clients. Client messages or messages sent by relay agents from clients to servers are not blocked.

IPv6 ND Inspection creates a binding table that is based on NS (Neighbor Solicitation) and NA (Neighbor Advertisement) messages. The switch then uses this table to check any future NS/NA messages. When the IPv6-LLA combination does not match, it drops the message. This only applies to NS/NA messages, it doesn’t drop any actual data packets that have a spoofed IPv6 or MAC address.

IPv6 Source Guard filters inbound traffic on L2 switch ports that are not in the IPv6 binding table. The binding table stores the following information:
+ IPv6 address
+ MAC address
+ VLAN
+ Interface ID

Source Guard only looks at information found in the binding table, and it doesn’t fill the binding table.

The IPv6 RA Guard feature provides support for allowing the network administrator to block or reject unwanted or rogue RA guard messages that arrive at the network device platform. RAs are used by devices to announce themselves on the link. The IPv6 RA Guard feature analyzes these RAs and filters out RAs that are sent by unauthorized devices.
```
