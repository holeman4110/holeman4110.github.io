## 1. 서론  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 두번째 자격증 목표인 CCNA를 위해 [Cisco CCNA 200-301 - The Complete Guide to Getting Certified](https://www.udemy.com/course/ccna-complete/) 강의를 Udemy에서 듣기 시작했다. 포스팅을 통해 정리도 하고 복습도 할겸 포스팅을 하려고 한다.

## 2. 본론  

### 1. OSI Model Benefits

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OSI Model의 장점(중요성)은 아래와 같다.

```
1. Enginners do not need to design a technology to work end to end from top to bottom of the model. They can just focus on their layer of expertise, and make sure they complay with the standars for the layers above and below
2. This leads to open standards and multi-vendor interoperability
3. For example: If you're an application developer, you can just focus on the top three layers, the lower layers are the domain of network engineers.
4. Troubleshooting is eaiser because you can analyse a problem in a logical fashion layer by layer
```

### 2. Cisco Operating Systems

```

## 3. 결론  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 아직까진 대부분 한국정보교육원 강의에서 들었던 내용들이지만 복습도되고 영어로 같은 내용을 다시 접할 수 있는점도 좋았다.
