## 1. 서론  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [RCHSA 기술개요](https://www.redhat.com/ko/services/training/ex200-red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhcsa-exam?section=%EB%AA%A9%ED%91%9C) RHCSA를 취득하기 위해 필요한 기술들이 나와있는 공홈 페이지다. 그에 따라 기존에 공부한 내용들을 연습하고 수정할 부분은 수정하여 최종적으로 모아 연습해볼 수 있도록 만든 포스팅이다.

## 2. 본론

```

### 2-2. LVM(Logical Volume Management

물리 저장소 추가 -> (fdisk로 파티션 생성, 시스템의 안정성을 위해 필요하다고 하는데 요즘은 물리저장소 추가할때는 굳이 안하는 경우도 많다고 함) -> pvcreate로 -> vgcreate -> lvcreate

#### 1. 예제1

```
Change the logical volume capacity 'lvo1' from 190M to 300M. And the size of the floating range should set between 280 and 320. (This logical volume has been mounted in advance.)

```
Remove logical volume and group we made above, and then make new one set 8M as a extends. Divided a volume group containing 50 extends(named 'lvshare') on volume group 'vgtest'. And the size of the floating range should set between 380M and 400M.
